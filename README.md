# plotly-challenge

In this challenge, I took data stored in json format and used the D3 library to read it in JavaScript. Using a flask app, I built an interactive dashboard to explore the data, allowing a user to choose a subject ID number from a dropdown menu. The other charts on the dashboard include demographic information, a bar chart with the top 10 OTU ids, a bubble chart of the OTU ids and a gauge chart showing the washing frequency per week for each subject ID the user chooses.
